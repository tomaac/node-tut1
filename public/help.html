  <h1> help! </h1>

  I need somebody<br />
  (Help) not just anybody<br />
  (Help) you know I need someone<br />
  (Help)<br />
  so much younger than today<br />
  (I never needed) I never needed anybody's help in any way<br />
  (Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone) I'm not so self-assured (and now I find)<br />
  Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors<br />
  Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br />
  And I do appreciate you being 'round<br />
  Help me get my feet back on the ground<br />
  Won't you please, please help me?<br />
  My independence seems to vanish in the haze<br />
  (But) but every now and then (now and then) I feel so insecure (I know that I)<br />
  I know that I just need you like I never done before<br />

  And I do appreciate you being 'round<br />
  Help me get my feet back on the ground<br />
  Won't you please, please help me?<br />

  Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors<br />
  Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br />
  And I do appreciate you being 'round<br />
  Help me get my feet back on the ground<br />
  Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh?<br />
